## Future Cybersecurity Services

At PixelShield Agency, we plan to expand our capabilities into advanced cybersecurity solutions designed to help businesses secure their digital infrastructures and stay ahead of emerging threats.

These services are currently **under development** and will be part of our future roadmap.

## What We Aim to Offer

Our future cybersecurity suite will focus on identifying vulnerabilities, detecting misconfigurations, and improving the overall resilience of websites and web applications.

Planned services include:

- Vulnerability scanning  
- Flag discovery within websites and web systems  
- Penetration testing simulations  
- Security audits and risk analysis  
- Code-level security review  
- Automated security alerts  
- Web hardening recommendations  

## Flag Detection and Remediation

A key component of our future platform will be **flag identification** — a methodology used to uncover hidden weaknesses within a website, such as:

- Hidden endpoints  
- Unsafe API routes  
- Leaking environment variables  
- Client-side exposed secrets  
- Misconfigured authentication/authorization  
- Outdated or vulnerable dependencies  

Once detected, the system will provide:

- Detailed remediation steps  
- Risk severity reports  
- Automated patch recommendations  

## Pentesting Approach

Our pentesting method will include:

- Reconnaissance and surface mapping  
- Automated and manual exploit attempts  
- Behavioural analysis  
- Security misconfiguration testing  
- Real-world attack simulations  

These processes ensure we replicate actual threat scenarios safely and responsibly.

## Long-Term Vision

In the future, PixelShield aims to deliver a platform that enables:

- Real-time security detection  
- Automated vulnerability scoring  
- Suggested fixes and patch workflows  
- Continuous monitoring  
- Security compliance assistance  

Our goal is to make advanced cybersecurity accessible for businesses of all sizes.
